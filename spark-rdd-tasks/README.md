# Spark RDD Based Tasks

This module includes data processing tasks implemented using the **Apache Spark RDD API**.  
RDDs allow fine-grained control over data transformations and are suitable for low-level distributed operations.

### Included Notebooks
- **Capital Distance Analysis** – Find closest and furthest capital city pairs using geodesic distance.
- **Seismic Event Detection** – Identify foreshocks and aftershocks based on time and spatial proximity.
- **Lottery Triple Pattern Mining** – Detect most frequently drawn number triples in historical lottery data.
- **Currency Daily Change Detection** – Find top 5 days with highest percentage increase in exchange rates.

All tasks demonstrate practical Spark RDD usage for real-world big data scenarios.
