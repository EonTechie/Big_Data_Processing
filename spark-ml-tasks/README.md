### Leaf Species Classification Optimization

This notebook demonstrates use of **Spark MLlib** to build and evaluate multiple classification models on the UCI Leaf dataset.  
It includes:

- Train-validation-split and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Accuracy comparison between Random Forest, GBT, etc.

This task illustrates how to apply distributed machine learning workflows using Spark for structured datasets.
